This program has been designed to test two ways of converting 2's Complement 
binary strings into their decimal format. The first method involves using Java's
native libraries to complement the binary strings, convert them to decimal
using Java's native method, and then add one. The second method involves
grabbing the largest value from the binary string, and subtracting each subsequently
smaller value from the largest value. The program aims to prove that both methods of 
conversion are accurate, and aims to test wether or not one is more efficient!
